            Pokémon are creatures of all shapes and sizes who live in the wild or alongside humans. For the most part, Pokémon do not speak except to utter their names. Pokémon are raised their owners (called “Trainers”). During their adventures, Pokémon grow and become more experienced and even, on occasion, evolve into stronger Pokémon. There are currently more than 800 creatures that inhabit the Pokémon universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are over a dozen different types of Pokémon, such as Fire type, Psychic type, and Dragon type. Every Pokémon type comes with both advantages as well as disadvantages when battling different Pokémon types. For instance, a Fire type Pokémon has the edge against Grass type Pokémon, but will be at a disadvantage against Water type Pokémon.

            A Pokémon journey is a quest undertaken by a Pokémon Trainer to learn to live and work with Pokémon. A trainer can start their journey as early as the age of 10, when they can first legally apply for a Pokémon Trainer's license. It is at this point that a Pokémon Professor can give them a starter Pokémon native to their own region. Then it is time to enter the tall grass where you will encounter new pokemon, trainer battles, and so much more!
          </p>
          <p>
            This journey is typically focused on defeating the region's eight Pokémon Gyms, defeating the Elite Four, and becoming the Champion, though there are often sidequests along the way. A villainous team will always show up during the journey to impede the trainer's progress and it is up to you whether you want to stop them!
