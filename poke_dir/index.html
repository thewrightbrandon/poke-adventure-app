            Pokémon are creatures of all shapes and sizes who live in the wild or alongside humans. For the most part, Pokémon do not speak except to utter their names. Pokémon are raised their owners (called “Trainers”). During their adventures, Pokémon grow and become more experienced and even, on occasion, evolve into stronger Pokémon. There are currently more than 800 creatures that inhabit the Pokémon universe.

            There are over a dozen different types of Pokémon, such as Fire type, Psychic type, and Dragon type. Every Pokémon type comes with both advantages as well as disadvantages when battling different Pokémon types. For instance, a Fire type Pokémon has the edge against Grass type Pokémon, but will be at a disadvantage against Water type Pokémon. This makes strategic thinking, positioning and use of the Pokémon in your team a crucial part of battles.

            A Pokémon journey is a quest undertaken by a Pokémon Trainer to learn to live and work with Pokémon. In the anime, a person's Pokémon journey can begin as early as the age of 10, when they can first legally apply for a Pokémon Trainer's license. It is at this point that a Pokémon Professor can give them a starter Pokémon native to their own region, though many people befriend or are given other Pokémon prior to being legally able to be Trainers.

            The core series games chronicle the Pokémon journey of an individual Trainer, the player, across a region that is dependent on the game being played. The player will often begin a journey around the same time as one or more rivals, whom they will meet at various points through their travels, and may battle against or along with them. This journey is typically focused on defeating the region's eight Pokémon Gyms, defeating the Elite Four, and becoming the Champion, though there are often sidequests along the way. A villainous team will always show up during the journey to impede the player's progress, and often, after the Pokémon League has been conquered, several post-League areas are available to continue the journey.
